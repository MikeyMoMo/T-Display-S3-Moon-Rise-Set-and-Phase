# T-Display-S3-Moon-Rise-Set-and-Phase
This is an active moon phase display with a moving star field on the main screen.  Via the menu, you can access a second screen that shows Full Moon, Last Quarter, New Moon and First Quarter dates in text.

The initial goal was to show a moon with an overlay of the shadow.  This was accomplished and a few things were added.  There is a slowly moving starfield behind the moon that gets eclipsed by the moon image as it would look in real life.  The stars are random different sizes and brightnesses.  I tried for close to reality.

On the second screen, accessed through a two-button menu, is a screen that shows the four major names phases of the moon and the next date on which they will occur.

Pictures, below.
